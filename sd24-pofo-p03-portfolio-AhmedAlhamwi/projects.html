            <p>Hier komt informatie over mijn projecten.</p>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I have worked on various projects in the field of ICT.</p>
            <h3>Project 1: Higher-Lower Game</h3>
            <p>My first project was creating a Higher-Lower Game. The objective was to develop a game where the player could play individually or against the computer. The game needed a proper layout using HTML and CSS and the functionality was made with JAVASCRIPT, a credit system for betting, and buttons for wagering and guessing. I chose to make it a single-player experience. The game is structured so that the player can restart once their credit reaches -2600, and they win when they accumulate 3600 credits.</p>
            <h3>Project 2: Build a New Game</h3>
            <p>The second project, "Build a New Game", involved creating a game island where the player could navigate to three different games of their choice. I was responsible for designing the main page layout and developing a chess game. My chess game includes a 1v1 mode and a 1vComputer mode, where the difficulty level can be adjusted. My teammates each worked on different games: one developed Tic-Tac-Toe, while another created Battleship. In this project it I had also to create it with JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS</p>
            <h3>Projects 3 & 4</h3>
            <p>Details for these projects will be added later.</p>
